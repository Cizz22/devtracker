# Developer Time Tracking App

Look, I made this app to track coding time because somehow I always end up saying "Yeah I've been coding all day" in standups while actually spending 4 hours picking the perfect VS Code theme. I don't really know what I'm doing. Built this with Spring Boot because everyone says it's cool, added GraphQL because REST is so 2020 and I like to overcomplicate things.

Done:
- Track projects

WIP:
- Monitor Git activity
- Track IDE events
- Generate stats

The code is probably a mess, but at least it's work. And yes, I spent more time writing this README than actually coding some features.

Tech stack:
- Java 21 
- Spring Boot
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL
- Flyway
